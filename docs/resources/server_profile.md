# oneview\_server\_profile
Creates or updates a Server Profile.
## Example Usage

Create server profile with local storages.
```hcl
resource "oneview_server_profile" "default" {
  name = "test-server-profile"
  hardware_name = "00AT092 bay 2"
  type = "ServerProfileV10"
  local_storage {
    controller {
      device_slot       = "Embedded"
      drive_write_cache = "Unmanaged"
      initialize        = false
      import_configuration = false
      mode                     = "RAID"
      predictive_spare_rebuild = "Unmanaged"
      logical_drives {
        name                = "LD-1"
	drive_number	    = 1
	num_physical_drives = 2
        bootable            = false
        drive_technology    = "SasHdd"
        raid_level          = "RAID1"
        accelerator         = "Unmanaged"
      }
      logical_drives {
        name                = "LD-2"
	drive_number	    = 2
	num_physical_drives = 2
        bootable            = false
        drive_technology    = "SasHdd"
        raid_level          = "RAID1"
        accelerator         = "Unmanaged"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Update: Removing LD-1 Logical Drive from the server profile.

Note: If you want to delete a block from the server profile resource, you will need to keep it as a empty block in your configuration.
```hcl
resource "oneview_server_profile" "default" {
  name = "test-server-profile"
  hardware_name = "00AT092 bay 2"
  type = "ServerProfileV10"
  local_storage {
    controller {
      device_slot       = "Embedded"
      drive_write_cache = "Unmanaged"
      initialize        = false
      import_configuration = false
      mode                     = "RAID"
      predictive_spare_rebuild = "Unmanaged"
      
      // Keeping logical_drive as an empty block in its position to delete it.
      logical_drives {
      }
      
      logical_drives {
        name                = "LD-2"
	drive_number	    = 2
	num_physical_drives = 2
        bootable            = false
        drive_technology    = "SasHdd"
        raid_level          = "RAID1"
        accelerator         = "Unmanaged"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Create server profile using server profile template.
```hcl
resource "oneview_server_profile" "default" {
  name = "test-server-profile"
  template = "${oneview_server_profile_template.test.name}"
}
```
Update request for server profile
```hcl
resource "oneview_server_profile" "default" {
       operation_type {
          name = "reapply_SAN_storage"        
          
        }
        name = "TestSP"
        type = "ServerProfileV10"
        server_hardware_type = "SY 480 Gen9 3"
        enclosure_group = "SYN03_EC"
        hardware_name = "SYN03_Frame3, bay 1"
}
```

Update request for renaming  logical drive name
```hcl
resource "oneview_server_profile" "default" {
      operation_type {
          name = "rename_logical_drive"
          logical_drive_value{
            device_slot_name="Embedded"
            current_logical_drive_name="ld2"
            new_logical_drive_name="ld3"
          }        
          
        } 
        name = "TestSP"
        type = "ServerProfileV10"
        server_hardware_type = "SY 480 Gen9 3"
        enclosure_group = "SYN03_EC"
        hardware_name = "SYN03_Frame3, bay 1"
