## Argument Reference

* `hardware_name` - (Optional) The name of the Server Hardware the server will be provisioned on.
  If this isn't used, a server hardware will be picked based on compatibility with the server profile template and any hw_filter(s) (see below).

* `hw_filter` - (Optional) List of filters to apply to the search for HW. See the OneView API docs pertaining to common filter query params, but the basic format is `[not] {attribute} {operator} '{value}'`. For example, `hw_filter = ["memoryMb >= 4096", "processorCoreCount = 4", "processorSpeedMhz >= 2400", "processorType regex '^Intel.*'"]`

* `power_state` - (Optional) Power state to enforce; `"on"` or `"off"`
