# terraform-provider-oneview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview)

A Terraform provider for oneview

## Installing `terraform-provider-oneview` with Go

* Install Go 1.11. For previous versions, you may have to set your `$GOPATH` manually, if you haven't done it yet.
* Install Terraform 0.11.x [from here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and save it into `/usr/local/bin/terraform` folder (create it if it doesn't exists). This provider DOES NOT SUPPORT Terraform 0.12 or above.
* Download the code by issuing a `go get` command.

```bash
# Download the source code for terraform-provider-oneview
# and build the needed binary, by saving it inside $GOPATH/bin
$ go get -u github.com/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview

# Copy the binary to have it along the terraform binary
$ mv $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-oneview /usr/local/bin/terraform
```



## Using `terraform-provider-oneview` with Docker


We also provide a lightweight and easy way to test and execute `terraform-provider-oneview`. The `prisood/terraform-provider-oneview` docker image contains
an installation of Terraform and our provider you can use by just pulling down the Docker Image:

```bash
# Download and store a local copy of terraform-provider-oneview and
# use it as a Docker image.
$ docker pull prisood/terraform-provider-oneview

# Run docker commands using the "ash" shell from Alpine, this will create
# a sh session where you can create files, issue commands and execute both
# terraform and the provider with ease.
$ docker run -it prisood/terraform-provider-oneview /bin/sh
```


### Provider Information

For authentication, you need to provide the provider information in examples:


```bash
provider "oneview" {
	ov_username = "<ov_username>"
	ov_password = "<ov_password>"
	ov_endpoint = "<ov_endpoint>"
	ov_sslverify = true/false
	ov_apiversion = <ov_apiversion>
	ov_domain = "<ov_domain>"
	ov_ifmatch = "*"
}
```

Note: Currently this SDK supports OneView API 1600 minimally where we can test OneView API 1600 version with this SDK. No new fields have been added/deleted to support API 1600 version. Complete support will be done in next releases.
