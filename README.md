## Introduction

HPE OneView makes it simple to deploy and manage today’s complex hybrid cloud infrastructure. HPE OneView can help you transform your data center to software-defined, and it supports HPE’s broad portfolio of servers, storage, and networking solutions, ensuring the simple and automated management of your hybrid infrastructure. Software-defined intelligence enables a template-driven approach for deploying, provisioning, updating, and integrating compute, storage, and networking infrastructure.

The HPE OneView Terraform SDK enables developers to easily build integrations and scalable solutions with HPE OneView.

You can find the latest supported HPE OneView Terraform Provider SDK [here](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview/releases/tag/v8.3.0-13)

## What's New

HPE OneView Terraform SDK library extends support of the SDK to OneView REST API version 5400 (OneView v8.40)

Please refer to [notes](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more information on the changes , features supported and issues fixed in this version
### Migration to HPE OneView 7.0 from HPE OneView 6.x ( Non-Synergy appliance )
With HPE OneView 7.0 one can migrate his/her server hardware from HPE OneView 6.x using migrate functionality provided in the UI. 
With server hardware migration , corresponding server profile will also get migrated to HPE OneView 7.0 . 

#### Impact after migration
1. Idempotency issues post migration.
Post migration do run terraform refresh to sync with migrated resources.

    Steps: 
    -  Point your <TF_VAR_endpoint> to HPE OneView 8.3.
    -  Run `terraform refresh` to sync with  migrated resource 
  
2. Idempotency issue in server profile after migration.
In HPE OneView 7.0 the server hardware type field is not compatible with HPE OneView 6.x server hardware type. To resolve that, while creating server profile, make sure terraform configuration file is not having server hardware type field defined . 


  

## Getting Started 

## Installation and Configuration

## Installing `terraform-provider-oneview` with Go

HPE OneView SDK for Terraform can be installed from Source or Docker container installation methods. You can either use a docker container which will have the HPE OneView SDK for terraform installed or perform local installation manually.

### Docker Setup
The light weight containerized version of the HPE OneView SDK for Terraform is available in the [Docker Store](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-terraform/general). The Docker Store image tag consist of two sections: <sdk_version-OV_version>

```bash
# Download and store a local copy of oneview-sdk-for-terraform and use it as a Docker Image.
$ docker pull hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-terraform:v8.4.0-OV8.4
# Run docker commands below given, which  will in turn create a sh session 
# where you can create files, issue commands and execute the examples.
$ docker run -it docker pull hewlettpackardenterprise/hpe-oneview-sdk-for-terraformv8.4.0-OV8.4 /bin/sh
```

### Local Setup

Local installation requires
- Installing Go
```bash 
$ apt-get install build-essential git wget
$ wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.15.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz

#unzip and untar the file 
$ tar -zxvf go1.15.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# move it to /usr/local/ and create directory for Go.
$ mv go/ /usr/local/ 
$ mkdir ~/go
```
```bash 
# Setting Environment Variable 
$ export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go 
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

- Installing Terraform

	Install Terraform 1.1.x from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and save it into `/usr/local/bin/terraform` folder (create it if it doesn't exists).



- Install Oneview Terraform Provider SDK from Terraform Registry

     Terraform 0.13 added support for automatically downloading providers from
the terraform registry. Add the following to your terraform project

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
  required_providers {
    oneview = {
      source = "HewlettPackard/oneview"
    }
  }
```
## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Following environment variables can be set for testing:

```bash
# Required
$ export TF_VAR_endpoint=<ov_endpoint>
$ export TF_VAR_username=<ov_username>
$ export TF_VAR_password=<ov_password>
$ export TF_VAR_ssl_enabled=false
$ export TF_VAR_ov_domain=<ov_domain>
```

### OneView Client Configuration

The OneView Client configuration options that can be passed during OneView Client object creation:
The variables are defined in [variable.tf](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview/blob/master/variables.tf) file.

For OneView authentication, you need to provide the provider information in examples:

```terraform
# Create terraform OneView client
provider "oneview" {
	ov_username  = "${var.username}"
	ov_password  = "${var.password}"
	ov_endpoint  = "${var.endpoint}"
	ov_sslverify = "${var.ssl_enabled}"
	ov_domain    = "${var.ov_domain}"
	ov_apiversion = <ov_apiversion>
	ov_ifmatch = "*"
}

```

:lock: Tip: Check the file permissions because the password is stored in clear-text as Environment Variable.

### HPE Synergy Image Streamer

From Release 8.1, Image streamer is no longer supported.

### Testing the Terraform Resources: 

In the home directory of project(terraform-provider-oneview) user needs to create (or) copy  the file that is to be executed. 

Sample example manifests are available in [example](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview/blob/master/examples) directory. 

The following terraform commands has to be executed to test the example. 
```terraform
$ terraform init 
$ terraform plan 
$ terraform apply
```
Note: Only a single terraform file (example file) should exist in the home folder to execute the above mentioned three commands. Once the resource is tested move that file to examples folder. 

Note: Currently this SDK supports OneView API 5400 minimally, where we can test OneView API 5400 version with this SDK. If API version used is not supported then error will be thrown. If API version is not provided then appliance's maximum supported API version will be used. 

## API Implementation

A detailed list of the HPE OneView REST interfaces that have been implemented in this SDK can be found in the [endpoints-support.md](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/terraform-provider-oneview/blob/master/endpoints-support.md) file.
